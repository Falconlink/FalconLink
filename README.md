<h3>How to deploy to a server:</h3>
<h4>Without a reverse proxy</h4>

1. Clone the repository on your server (run "git clone https://github.com/Falconlink/FalconLink")

2. Go to the directory Falconlink is stored in (run "cd FalconLink")

3. Install the nodejs packages (run "npm i")

4. Start the server (run "PORT=8080 npm start" or "$env:PORT=8080; npm start" depending on your server - Note: Edit the number to change the port it is hosted on)

5. You have successfully deployed FalconLink! 

<h4>Using Caddy (Best for a VPS, will automatically create an SSL certificate for any domain with an A record pointing to it)</h4>

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker-compose installed.

2. Clone the repository on your server (run "git clone https://github.com/Falconlink/FalconLink")

3. Go to the directory Falconlink is stored in (run "cd FalconLink")

4. Make the installation script executable (run "chmod +x caddy.sh")
